# Review rules for `exeris-caps-circuit-breaker`

The `repo-routine` extension of `exeris-systems/.github`'s `docs-guardrails-review.md`, applied
**after** its parts and under its severity tags, output format and verdict schema. It adds checks
and raises severities; it lowers nothing and skips nothing. One review, one verdict, one publisher.
A finding cites a rule of this file as `repo-review-rules.md#S<n>`.

**The criteria are not authored here.** They are stated by this repository's `AGENTS.md`,
`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `SECURITY.md`, and by the build that enforces them. This file names the
questions a reviewer must reach for and the severity each answer carries; where a rule restates a
sentence of those documents, the document is the one to read and to change.

## What this repository is answerable for

`exeris-caps-circuit-breaker` is a single-module Exeris capability (Layer 3 — Gateway policy), licence commercial (Exeris Commercial License 1.1), a proof of concept with
no published artefact. Other capabilities and the SKUs that compose them compile against its
`@Provides` services (`CircuitBreakerRegistry`, `CircuitBreakerAdmin`), so a contract broken here breaks a composition elsewhere while this build stays
green. The shared `code` part judges whether a change is correct. What it cannot know is which of this
capability's surfaces and invariants its own documents promise, and that is what follows.

## Step S — rules of this repository

S1. **The cap-tier Wall holds** (ADR-055, ADR-006; `AGENTS.md` §2). Only what the build's Wall check
    enforces is asserted here: the check is `CapTierWall` in `exeris-tooling`, run by
    `exeris:verify-capabilities` at `process-classes` over the compiled main classes, and it rejects
    a reference to `org.springframework.*`, `io.netty.*`, `reactor.*` or `jakarta.servlet.*`, to
    kernel internals (`eu.exeris.kernel.**.internal.**`), and to a sibling capability's `internal`
    package; the public (non-`internal`) packages of `exeris-kernel-spi` and `exeris-kernel-core` are the kernel this capability may name. In a diff: such
    an import in `src/main`; a dependency in `pom.xml` that brings one in; a rename of the package
    root `eu.exeris.caps.breaker` or an extra segment in it, because the guard derives the
    capability's name from the segment after `eu.exeris.caps.`;
    `eu.exeris.caps.breaker.internal` is private to this capability and
    `eu.exeris.caps.breaker.api` is the cross-cap surface, and an `internal` type in a
    public signature → `[HARD BLOCK]`. A Spring, servlet, Netty or reactor import in `src/test` is
    outside what the guard scans and is still forbidden by `AGENTS.md` → `[CONTRACT]`. A kernel
    driver dependency (`exeris-kernel-community` or an enterprise driver) outside `test` scope →
    `[HARD BLOCK]`: the driver is chosen by the SKU, never by a capability.

S2. **The committed manifest is regenerated, never edited.**
    `src/main/generated/java/cap-manifest.json` is written by `exeris:generate`, and a clean
    `git status` after `mvn verify` shows it matches the declaration. A diff that edits it by hand,
    touches the module class (`@CapabilityModule`, `@Provides`, `@Requires`) without carrying the
    regenerated manifest, carries a manifest change with no declaration change, or leaves a manifest
    that disagrees with the annotations (a `@Provides` version, a `@Requires` range or `optional`
    flag, an `initOrder`) → `[HARD BLOCK]`. A manifest whose `stamp.validated` is not `true` →
    `[HARD BLOCK]`.

S3. **Service contracts are `0.1.0` while the capability is unreleased**
    (`standards/capability-conventions.md` rule 9). While no artefact of this capability has been
    published, every `@Provides` declares `version = "0.1.0"` and every `@Requires` on an unreleased
    contract declares `[0.1.0,0.2.0)`; a declaration at `1.0.0` or higher, or a range that is not
    `[0.1.0,0.2.0)`, → `[CONTRACT]`. A pre-release breaking change does not bump the version: it
    keeps `0.1.0` and its Compatibility impact line is `breaking (ADR-NNN)` of the accepted ADR
    that governs this capability. **An unreleased capability keeps no `accepted-api-changes.json`;
    the first released version starts it.** The reviewer therefore does not ask for that file, an
    entry in it, or a japicmp baseline on a pre-release pull request, and does not read the absence
    of a version bump as a finding. A pull request that publishes the first release is the one in
    which the register starts, and rule 24 of the shared routine then applies in full.

S4. **The entitlement id is the artifactId.** This is a `commercial` capability (Exeris Commercial
    License 1.1, ADR-023). Where the capability registers an `EntitlementRequirement`
    (`META-INF/services/eu.exeris.kernel.spi.contract.EntitlementRequirement`), the capability id
    it names is `exeris-caps-circuit-breaker`, the artifactId and without the groupId (ADR-088,
    ADR-089). A registration whose id is anything else, or that is made conditional → `[HARD BLOCK]`:
    in a production-class environment the kernel refuses to start without a licence that lists that
    id. The licence in `LICENSE`, the POM and the README moves together, and a change to one alone →
    `[CONTRACT]`.

S5. **No dependency creep.** The runtime classpath stays what the POM declares and the README
    lists: `exeris-sdk-annotations` at `provided` (every Exeris annotation is `@Retention(SOURCE)`)
    and nothing else at `compile` scope unless the README names it. A new `compile`-scope dependency, a
    logging implementation such as Logback or Log4j (use `System.Logger`, ADR-060), or a new sibling
    capability with no matching `@Requires` or README line → `[CONTRACT]`. Reading an Exeris
    annotation at runtime → `[HARD BLOCK]`.

S6. **The build baseline and the test contract hold** (`AGENTS.md` §2, `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
    `maven.compiler.release` stays 25 and no `--enable-preview` appears in any scope →
    `[HARD BLOCK]`. Tests use JUnit 5 and AssertJ only, with hand-written doubles and no mocking
    framework (ADR-058) → `[CONTRACT]`. A bug fix lands with the test that fails without it →
    `[CONTRACT]` when absent.

S7. **Verification names what ran.** A local run may be cited as
    `target/surefire-reports` at `<sha>`, and the reviewer accepts that as the evidence of what ran
    locally. A Verification that claims a pass without a command, report path or sha → `[STYLE]`.

S8. **A refusing state refuses.** `acquirePermission` returns a permit that is not `permitted()` while a
    breaker is `OPEN` and its wait period has not passed, and always while it is `FORCED_OPEN`; a
    `HALF_OPEN` generation issues no more probe permits than the configuration allows. A change that
    admits a call through such a breaker, or issues more probes than configured → `[HARD BLOCK]`.

S9. **Outcomes are bound to permits and move the state machine as configured.** The outcome methods
    (`onSuccess`, `onError`, `onOutcome`) take the `Permit` the call was admitted under; every state
    transition increments the generation; an outcome whose permit is not of the current generation (or was
    already completed, rejected or foreign) is counted in the metrics only and never drives a transition;
    only permits issued in a `HALF_OPEN` generation count as probes. An outcome method without a permit, a
    stale outcome that drives a transition or counts as a probe, a transition that ignores the configured
    failure-rate threshold, minimum number of calls or window, or one that can leave a breaker in
    `HALF_OPEN` with no way out → `[HARD BLOCK]`. A deprecated or overloaded permit-less outcome method is
    the same finding.

S10. **State changes are lock-free and atomic.** `LockFreeCircuitBreaker` swaps one phase object per
    generation with a compare-and-set; concurrent callers must never observe or produce an impossible
    state. A lock, a read-then-write on state that is not a compare-and-set, or a counter shared across
    generations → `[CONTRACT]`.

S11. **The registry is keyed by name and bounded.** `getOrCreate(name)` returns the one breaker for a name
    under concurrency, and the registry holds at most `maxBreakers()` (default 1024). Creating one beyond
    the limit is `CircuitBreakerLimitExceededException` plus the `limitRejections()` counter. A change that
    can create two breakers for one name, can exceed the limit, silently drops the request, or evicts a
    breaker to make room (LRU or otherwise) → `[CONTRACT]`; eviction of an open circuit's state is
    `[HARD BLOCK]`. A caller deriving a breaker name from request data → `[CONTRACT]`.

S12. **Manual control is a separate capability.** `CircuitBreaker` (the call-site interface) has no method
    that changes state by hand: no `transitionTo*`, `reset`, `forceOpen`, `disable` or `release`; those are
    `CircuitBreakerAdmin`, declared as its own `@Provides`. `FORCED_OPEN` and `DISABLED` are entered and left
    only by an admin action (`release`), never by an automatic transition. Every admin action takes an
    actor and is reported to the `AdminListener` (breaker name, action, previous state, new state,
    timestamp, actor) and logged. A state-changing method on the call-site interface, an automatic path
    into or out of a manual state, or an admin action that is not reported → `[CONTRACT]`.

S13. **Failure classification is in the contract.** `FailureClassifier.defaults()` counts exactly a transport
    error, a timeout and HTTP 500, 502, 503 and 504; no 4xx counts, 429 included, and its Javadoc and the
    README table state the same set. A different default, a 4xx or 429 counted by default, or a classifier
    that cannot be set per breaker through `CircuitBreakerConfig` → `[CONTRACT]`; a default table that no
    test covers → `[CONTRACT]`.

## Where this does not apply, and what it costs

The shared `code` and `pr` parts judge correctness, scope, the pull request's body and its commits, and the rules above are not a second copy of them. Whether a change to `internal` is correct is the `code` part's; what this file adds is the list of invariants this capability's own documents state, which a generic review cannot know to look for. Not to the pull request's body and commits, which the shared `pr` part judges, nor to comments
and Javadoc, which the shared `code-docs` part and the Javadoc gate judge.

The cost is that these rules are prose a reviewer applies, not a program. This repository hands the review no `repo-checks` output, so the Wall scan, the manifest comparison and the tests named above are evidence only through the build checks on the pull request, which the reviewer cannot read. A rule the reviewer could only check by running the build is reported as unchecked, not as passing.
